This directory contains the exact packages used to install Anaconda and pprpint (via pip). Git and Nano were installed using `yum install` and root/.bashrc has been modified to point to the Anaconda install (/Anaconda) and activate the bpnet environment. 

You may find all conda-managed dependencies in the .yml file here in this directory.

This Docker image is otherwise unmodified and is built on the latest CentOS 8 Docker Image release (as of 08-25-2020). Happy BPNet-ing!
