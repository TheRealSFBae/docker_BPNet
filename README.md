# BPNet on CentOS

Dockerized BPNet environment for easy distribution. Docker user andrewsg has a slightly different docker image that is build on Debian Linux, but I wanted to build up our environment on CentOS for a few reasons:
1. CentOS has a longer lifecycle schedule than Debian. This is good for stability and long-term use.
2. I like CentOS/RHEL.
3. Wynton and our lab servers are all CentOS based - any UCSF users who's intro to UNIX was via Wytnon will be familiar with this architecture
4. I like CentOS/RHEL.

More README to come.
