# BPNet on CentOS

Find docker image here: [https://hub.docker.com/r/angelopelonero/bpnet_centos8](https://hub.docker.com/r/angelopelonero/bpnet_centos8)

Dockerized [BPNet](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/737981v2) for easy distribution. Docker user andrewsg built [BPNet on Debian Linux](https://hub.docker.com/r/andrewsg/bpnet), but I wanted to build our environment on CentOS for a few reasons:

1. CentOS has a longer lifecycle schedule than Debian. This is good for stability and long-term use.
2. I like CentOS/RHEL.
3. Wynton and our lab servers are all CentOS based - any UCSF users who's intro to UNIX was via Wytnon will be familiar with this architecture
4. I like CentOS/RHEL.

More README to come.

## Setup

### Docker

1. Download/install Docker
2. Configure Docker resources + directory sharing
    - FWIW I mount my local Users folder and run BPNet directly in the directory share
3. Pull the Docker image
4. Start the container - recommended to run this interactively via `bash`:
    - First time launch from image (run once):
        - `docker run -u root -it --name BPNetCentOS -v /Users/:/host_system/ angelopelonero/bpnet_centos8 bash`
        - NOTE: the `-v` flag mounts the shared folder as follows `-v /path/to/local/folder2share/:/whatever_you_want_the_dir_called_in_your_container/`
        - Exit container using `exit` when finished. Container will persist in Docker as you left it.
        - Stop container using `docker stop BPNetCentOS`
    - To re-launch container:
        - `docker start BPNetCentOS`
        - `docker exec -it BPNetCentOS bash`
5. Run BPNet

##### A note on resource allocation:

A good starting point is to allocate 50% of your system resources to BPNet and adjust from there. Be sure to start "fresh," ideally after a restart, and monitor your system's resource usage as you work.

### Docker to Singularity (for HPC)

[coming soon]

##### BPNet config notes:

ðŸª†ðŸª†ðŸª†
This Docker image uses Anaconda to manage dependencies. Setup instructions were followed from the [Kundaje Lab BPNet GitHub](https://github.com/kundajelab/bpnet) with slight modifications.
ðŸª†ðŸª†ðŸª†

Prereqs (CentOS, also other systems):

- Anaconda/miniconda
- Git
- Nano (or any text editor)

Configure new conda env:

```
conda create -n bpnet python=3.6

### added this to end of bashrc to load env automatically
source activate bpnet

conda install -c bioconda pybedtools bedtools pybigwig pysam genomelake

pip install git+https://github.com/kundajelab/DeepExplain.git

pip install tensorflow~=1.14.0 # or tensorflow-gpu if you are using a GPU

### no longer on pip - tar.gz included in this repo
pip install pprint-0.1.tar.gz

pip install bpnet

echo 'export HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE' >> ~/.bashrc
```
These instructions should work on most systems running Anaconda and were what I used to configure BPNet both on my machines as well as in Docker. All files used for setup on CentOS + a short setup summary (in this repo: src/homedir_README.txt) can be found in the Docker Image at `/home/BPNetConda_setup_files/`.
